# Lie Ledger

The last year has shown us just how badly we need reliable sources for journalism, but fact-checking every one of the infinite stories
from all the websites on the internet is a monumental task. Tools in computing can only get us so far: neural networks might be able to
pick up some linguistic patterns in some cases, but how could they catch intentional, well-written deception? What would their standards be
for calling a fact "verified?" And who decides?

Lie Ledger is a crowd-sourced solution to this problem. It lives on the blockchain, so all contributions will remain censorship-free and
internationally available. It also has incentives built in for making quality contributions, and safe-guards against troll takeovers.

## How Will Users Interact With the Ledger?

The blockchain backend is almost like an API, and, once complete, will be accessible from any number of independent JavaScript applications
by way of the Web3 library. Some examples: a browser extension that would compare a user's current page with the repository of corrections and
show a notification if they match, a native mobile app that would do the same, analysis applications on the most frequently corrected sources, etc.

There will be a similar JavaScript GUI to submit corrections to the ledger once the contracts are deployed.

## How Do I Contribute?

Any way you want. There are some issues registered above in reference to the execution of the blockchain architecture and the payment algorithm.
If you're not familiar with Solidity, feel free to reach out, and we can talk about getting some front-end implementations under way concurrently.

### If you want to get involved with Ethereum, consider contributing to this project. It's an unusual application of blockchain technology that promises to be exciting, educational, and substantial!
